Hi!

I am the GIT MASTER.

Idea #1- The Fortune Teller Themed App:
This app will be multi-page. Each page, in a sense, showcases different things we have learned in class. 
There will be a log in page that goes to the user's homepage. The user from there will have a navigation bar 
that links to a magic 8 ball page (local mongo database generate randomly to give answers to the user's questions),
a crystal ball page (may link to an existing api, and randomly generate that "wisdom") and a tarot card page 
(this page will be using logic and be kind of like a choose you own adventure game).
This format would be easily split between 4 people. Each person could have a page to work on.

Idea #2- Diet Tumblr App:
Based on the app Tumblr, it would look very similar but be instead of blue its purple. Standard blog posts
with a profile and dashboard. You are able to re-blog post and comment on them. No api required. Would feature
a log in page.

Idea #3- Messenger App:
Allows you to connect with other people via hobbies and interests. Would feature
a log in page. Maybe use a foreign api.
