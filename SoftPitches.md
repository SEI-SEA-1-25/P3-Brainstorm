# WeChef:

Send 7-day meal plan conforming to user’s dietary guidelines, streamline information from recipe databases to the end user. Make it nice. 

Why?

Non-chefs do not know what they are doing, they need guidance. information on good recipes is very hard to find without sifting through unnecessary amounts of junk, personal blog stories, etc. and is often full of errors that a professional chef can easily catch!

So: Have a community of unpaid professional chef moderators who maintain the accuracy of the information, ensuring that it is accurate.
